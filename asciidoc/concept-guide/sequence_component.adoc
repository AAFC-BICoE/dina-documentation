== PCR Primer

Information about Primers used for amplification of a region on a targeted organism.

== Thermocycler Profile

Used to track different amplification cycles and melting temperature programmed for each gene region and its associated primer pairs.

== PcrBatch

Details of the PCR Master Mix used for gene amplification. PCRBatch will connect to Gene Region, PCR Primers and Thermocycler Profiles.

== PcrReaction

== NGS Index

Used to distinguish between different samples in a single sequencing run of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS).
