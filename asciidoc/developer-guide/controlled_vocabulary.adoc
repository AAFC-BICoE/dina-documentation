== Vocabulary

A Vocabulary represents a single thing/concept. An entry is composed of a `name`, a `term` and a `multilingualTitle` (`VocabularyElement` interface). They are platform defined and values are loaded from configuration files. They are usualy used to either suggest or restrict values for some fields defined in the DINA models.

Examples of vocabulary are : spatial reference system (SRS), type status, coordinate system ...

== Managed Attribute

A managed attribute also represents a single thing/concept. As opposed to vocabulary, they are user defined and values are loaded from the database.

Manage attribute extends vocabulary and adds the attributes `key`, `vocabularyElementType`, `acceptedValues`, and `multilingualDescription` through the `TypedVocabularyElement` interface.

They are used as semi-structured data where the `key` is stored with a value on the DINA models that support them.

== Field Extension

Field extension represents a set a terms/concepts that are logicialy grouped. They usualy comes from a standard defined by an external body. The `fields` of a specific field extension are also implementing the `TypedVocabularyElement` interface. Field extensions are platform defined and loaded from configuration files. 

They are used as semi-structured data where the extension, the version and the `key` are stored with a value on the DINA models that support them.
