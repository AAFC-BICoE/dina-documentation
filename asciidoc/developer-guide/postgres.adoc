=== Rename key in jsonb array
The following example is not the most performatn but is easier to follow.

The example is based on a table like :
----
CREATE TABLE organism (id integer, determinations jsonb);
----

The table has jsonb array in the `determinations` column:
----
INSERT INTO organism VALUES (1, '[
					{
						"scientificNameSource": "GNA",
						"isPrimary": true,
						"isFileAs": true
					},
          {
						"scientificNameSource": "GNA",
						"isPrimary": false,
						"isFileAs": false
					}
				]');
----

We want to rename the key `isFileAs` to `isFiledAs`:

----
-- unwrap the array and extract the value
WITH subquery AS (
  SELECT id, item, item -> 'isFileAs' as att_value
  FROM organism, jsonb_array_elements(determinations) as item
),
-- remove the old attribute and create the new one with the value
-- reconstruct the array by grouping by id
subquery2 AS (
  select id, json_agg(jsonb_set(item-'isFileAs', '{isFiledAs}', att_value)) as updated_jsonb from subquery
  GROUP BY id
)
 
UPDATE organism
  SET determinations = updated_jsonb
  FROM subquery2
  WHERE organism.id = subquery2.id;
