[start=5]
. Now all that's left to do is edit the Material Samples generated through the split. This step is similar to the creation of material samples as in the link:#createSample[Creating Material Sample(s) Section] - Step 3 and onwards.

[start=6]
. Once everything has been done, click on the `Save All` button at the top right corner of the page.

This process makes child samples with the intended sample type configured by the user. This process can be repeated for the child samples resulting to their own child samples as long as there is a Split Configuration with the appropriate Material Sample Type.
