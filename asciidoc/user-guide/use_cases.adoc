== Insect jar

We have a jar of insects gathered during a single event. From this jar, we are extract a single insect, from which we pull a leg for DNA sequencing.

In DINA this would be represented by 3 material samples.

```
┌───┐  ┌──────┐  ┌────┐
│jar├─►│insect├─►│leg │
└───┘  └──────┘  └────┘
```

Steps:

. Create a material-sample representing the jar (Mixed Organism): `JAR-1`
. Split `JAR-1` to create the material-sample for the single insect (Whole Organism): `BUG-1`
. Split `BUG-1` to create the material-sample for the dissection (Organism Part): `BUG-1-1`

```
┌─────┐  ┌─────┐       ┌───────┐
│JAR-1├─►│BUG-1├──────►│BUG-1-1│
├─────┤  ├─────┤       └┬──────┤
├─────┤ ┌┴─────┴──────┐ ├──────┴──────┐
│Event│ │Determination│ │Determination│
└─────┘ └─────────────┘ └─────────────┘
```

Notes:

* The event (collecting-event) is only attached to `JAR-1`. material-sample `BUG-1` and `BUG-1-1` will inherit it through `JAR-1`.
* Determination on `BUG-1` and `BUG-1-1` can differ based on the scientific activities of each.
