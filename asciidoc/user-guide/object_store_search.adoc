Quick exlaination of searchs

=== Search object attributes
While there are many attribues to search they fall into three groups
* Text - which can have any text in them
* List - a drop down list of limited choses
* Date - a calender data and time.

The search options for Text and List are the same

* Exact match
* Partial Match
* Not Equals 
* Empty 
* Not Empty 

---

A Note on partal match.

The method to make these searches fast on large dataset results in a partial search not gareunteeing to file a longer bit of text. For example there was a archive where doing a search on "book" did not return a "book1.txt"

Work is still being done to find the optimal tradoff between speed and returns

Date data type has the following comparitors

* Equals 
* Not Equals 
* Greater Than 
* Greater Than or Equal to 
* Less Than 
* Less Than or Equal to

. "Add Query" button allows adding a new query to the existing one if the search needs to be refined more
. "And" "OR" allows the search to be switched between the intersection of  all the queries and the union of all the querys
. "Query Field" selector sets the field the query comparison and the query value are set to
. "Query comparitors" determined how the Field value for an object is comparted to the query value
. "Query value" This options is to always present when it is the value compared to the query field
. "Search" and "Reset" buttons. The Search button applies the search to the object store showing only those object that meet the query. The Reset button ends the search and the page will display the full list of objects

=== combinigng multiple searches

Multiple searches can be combined for more accuray. For example all samples with a date of 2019 could be found by searching for those that are 
have a creation date Greather than or Equal to Jaunary 1st 2019
And
a create date Less than or Equal to Decepmber 31st 2019

The Or search can be used for combining multiple    

==== Example searches

.Dina Single Query Search
image::search03.png[Dina Single Query Search]

A single query Search will retrieve all abjects that match the query. In the case of Figure 2 above, all jpeg images. It can be see that there are 15 matches

.Dina Double Query AND Search
image::search04.png[Double Query AND Search]

Adding a second query as a AND will return all object that match all queries. In the case of Figure 3 above, All object that are jpeg images and have a Capation that is empty. As we can see there are 2 results.
