A quick explanation of searches

=== Search object attributes
While there are many attributes to search they fall into three groups
* Text – a label of any text
* List - a drop down list of limited choices
* Date - a calendar date and time.

The search options for Text and List are the same

* Exact match
* Partial Match
* Not Equals 
* Empty 
* Not Empty

A note on partial matches.

The method used to make searches fast on large datasets results in a partial search not gareunteeing to find a label containing those characters. For example there was a archive where doing a search on "book" did not return a "book1.txt"

Work is still being done to find the optimal tradeoff between speed and the completeness of results.

Date has the following search options

* Equals 
* Not Equals 
* Greater Than 
* Greater Than or Equal to 
* Less Than 
* Less Than or Equal to

=== Parts of the search page

Searches are created in the search section of the page

Two buttons exist at the right hand side of the page. These are Add Query and Add Sub Query.

The Add Query button is used to create a new criteria for the search. 

When a new criteria is added, an attribute , a search option, and a value for comparison are specified.

Only objects who’s attributes meet the criteria are included in the results

Additional queries can be added to the search by pressing the add button

. "Add Query" button allows adding a new query to the existing one if the search needs to be refined more
. "And" "OR" allows the search to be switched between the intersection of  all the queries and the union of all the querys
. "Query Field" selector sets the field the query comparison and the query value are set to
. "Query comparitors" determined how the Field value for an object is comparted to the query value
. "Query value" This options is to always present when it is the value compared to the query field
. "Search" and "Reset" buttons. The Search button applies the search to the object store showing only those object that meet the query. The Reset button ends the search and the page will display the full list of objects

=== combining multiple searches

Multiple searches can be combined for more accuray. For example all samples with a date of 2019 could be found by searching for those that are 
have a creation date Greater than or Equal to January 1st 2019
And
a create date Less than or Equal to December 31st 2019

The Or search can be used for combining multiple    

==== Example searches

.Dina Single Query Search

A single query Search will retrieve all abjects that match the query. In the case of Figure 2 above, all jpeg images. It can be see that there are 15 matches

.Dina Double Query AND Search

Adding a second query as a AND will return all object that match all queries. In the case of Figure 3 above, All object that are jpeg images and have a Capation that is empty. As we can see there are 2 results.
