== Metadata

Data about an object stored or represented in the object-store.

=== External Resource

External resources are represented in the object-store by a URL. No copy or storage of the file is available in the object-store but instead a link to the resource. This is mostly used to allow the object-store to point to a resource that could not be represented as a file (e.g. https://www.protocols.io/[protocols.io]) or that the level of protection required is higher than what the object-store can support.
