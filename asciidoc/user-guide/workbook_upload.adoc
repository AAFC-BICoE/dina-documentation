== Workbook Uploader
The Workbook Uploader feature in DINA allows users to upload sample data in bulk through an Excel sheet to the system. This feature is especially useful when users have a large amount of data to upload, as it saves time and effort compared to manual data entry.

[id=fileFormats]
=== Supported File Formats
Before using the Workbook Uploader make sure that the file to be uploaded has one of the following file formats:

* Excel Sheet (.xlsx)
* Comma Separated Values (.csv)

For columns that support multiple values (ex. listing multiple collectors per collecting event), separate the values using a semicolon.
